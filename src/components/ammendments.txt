good job now everything related selected transaction is over, now there is another problem, 
on dynamic price and quantity inputs, live profit and loss calculation is done and displayed next ot save transactions button, now the problem is that value calculated is wrong

things to fix
->for selling 1 of 100, 
    1]buy charges of 100 instead of 1 is applied
    2]shows loss as only 1 sold, dosent shows profit/loss from that sell

->modal ,when sell transaction is saved, dosent displays imp info
->display profit by selected sell when there are previous sell 
->presence of other sell transactions before the selected sell transaction,
    if that sell didnt completely sold out the shares of buy transaction, 
    then the next sell transaction should also consider that partial buy transaction, 
    
->seems like no purpose in displaying extra charges when
    more than 1 transaction selected
->compressed state making transaction not vissible for sold out companies in wallet tracker
->no point in keeping investor gender 



CORRECTED
->wrong live profit and loss value near the save transaction
->display profit by selected sell when there are previous sell 
->not able to upload json from mobile
->added deposit/withdraw transactions to the json and changes to wallet
